    <h2>General Theme Shows:</h2>
    <p>
      These six shows have stories that children know (such as "The Three Little Pigs" or "The Enormous Turnip") and stories that they don't know (such as "The Squeaky Door" or "There Was an Old Man who Swallowed a Toad" ). These stories can also create themed shows—shows about animals, food, insects, stories from around the world, and more.
    </p>
   <p>
      Shows include a series of short stories, each using a different type of puppet—shadow,  swallow, puppdoll, box theater, and more. Most puppets are handmade and some can be made by children. Shows may also contain flannel board stories, cut and tell stories, string stories, songs and more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you’d like, Merlajean can end the show with a story that uses a puppet that the children can make. Some schools have Merlajean stay to help make the puppets, but it’s not necessary. If you prefer to have the children make a puppet without Merlajean, she will send a list of materials to have on hand, and will explain to the class how to make the puppet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      General Theme Shows are appropriate for Pre-K through grade Six.

    <h2>Holiday shows:</h2>
	
   <section class="spaced">  <strong>  Halloween </strong>- Cute, non-scary stories about a little girl dressed up to look like a witch, a monster who is afraid of himself when wearing a Halloween mask, and a ghost who goes trick or treating. The show ends with Witch’s Brew being made on an overhead projector. <br></section> 

   <section class="spaced"> <strong>  Thanksgiving</strong> - In this show, one Native American story is told—the rest are about turkeys and food. There’s a story about a turkey who eats too many lollipops, a boy who eats too much turkey, and more. This show has both a draw and tell and a cut and tell story.<br></section> 

   <section class="spaced"> <strong>  Christmas</strong> - Along with winter stories (see below), there’s a story about a mouse choosing a Christmas tree, and a story about an elf, reindeer, Mrs. Clause and, of course, Santa. Where appropriate, the story of Jesus’ birth is told with an unusual doll puppet.<br></section> 

   <section class="spaced"> <strong> Valentine's Day</strong> - These stories are mostly about parent/child love. One of children’s favorites is ‘I Want Another Mother’ which is about a mouse who wants another bedtime kiss. There’s also a story about a child who eats all of her Mother’s Valentine’s candy, and who wants to give her Daddy a BIG cut-out heart.<br></section> 

   <section class="spaced"> <strong> Winter Stories</strong> - Exciting stories about a crazy sled ride, a strange penguin, and melting snowmen.<br>
